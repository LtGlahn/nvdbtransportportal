# Vegkart 

Vegkart is the tool for learning and browsing NVDB data and road network. For many  use cases the CSV download utility is sufficient, but Vegkart is also an excellent starting point for learning how to build API queries. 

### Vegkart main components 

1. **Map canvas** - which also is a geographic filter, so zooming and panning will affect the results. _(This can be overruled by adding the name of specific geographic areas of interest to the query box)_. The map is interactive: Clicking on a road will display road number and other [road reference info](./konsept4_roadreference.md), and clicking on a feature will display info about the feature. 
2. **Our logo** (refresh) and **info** (opens the welcome splash screen). 
3. **Map controls**. Zoom, background map. 
4. **Query box**. This is the heart of Vegkart, with loads of filtering and quering options, including but not limited to road number, municipality and name of feature type.
