### Road network glossary

For the convenience of English users, we provide a short description of the most common NVDB terms. Most of these terms are [SOSI standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOSI) terminology, which may partly overlap with NVDB generic terminology. Please visit the [Norwegian Mapping Authority SOSI description](https://www.kartverket.no/en/geodataarbeid/SOSI-Standard-in-English/SOSI-Standard-in-English/) for more details.
